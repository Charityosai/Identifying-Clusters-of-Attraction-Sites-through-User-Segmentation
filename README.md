Title: Identifying Clusters of Attraction Sites through User Segmentation

The goal of this project is to apply clustering algorithms to a travel review dataset to identify 
distinct user segments within the vast community of travellers based on similar preferences. 
This segmentation can be used for tailoring travel recommendations to enhance user 
experience. 

This data set used was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It was populated 
by capturing user ratings from Google reviews. Reviews of attractions from 24 categories 
across Europe are considered. Google user rating ranges from 1 to 5 and the average user rating 
per category is calculated.
